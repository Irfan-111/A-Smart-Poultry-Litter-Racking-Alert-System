Revolutionizing poultry farming practices, I spearheaded the development of a groundbreaking Smart Poultry Litter Racking Alert System, driven by advanced deep learning technology. This system provides real-time monitoring of critical litter conditions such as moisture levels, temperature, and ammonia concentration, empowering farmers with proactive alerts and predictive maintenance capabilities. Through intuitive user interfaces and sophisticated algorithms, the system enables informed decision-making, leading to enhanced poultry welfare, cost savings through risk mitigation, and promotion of sustainable farming practices. This project represents a pioneering solution at the forefront of agriculture and technology, reshaping the landscape of poultry farming towards greater efficiency, profitability, and animal welfare.
